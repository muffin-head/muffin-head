### 🚀 About Me

I’m a data alchemist on a mission to transform messy reality into reliable insights. With over 5 years of experience across healthcare, finance, and compliance, I specialize in:

- ✅ **Production-grade ML Systems** with full observability, privacy-awareness, and rollback safety.
- 🌐 **Cloud-Native MLOps Pipelines** using Azure, Databricks, and AWS (SageMaker, Glue, EventHub, ADF).
- 🧩 **Research-to-Deployment Workflows** with advanced time series models and clinical applications.
- ⚙️ **GenAI + Infrastructure Automation**, building pipelines that talk, adapt, and recover.

By night, I decode ECG signals to detect sepsis. By day, I deploy GenAI workflows with drift monitoring, audit trails, and infrastructure-as-code.

### 📌 What I’m Up To

- 🌡 Detecting **neonatal sepsis** in real-time NICU settings with custom DL models and biosignal processing (GAF/TMF).
- 📈 Streaming 10,000+ financial signals for a **real estate investment anomaly detector** on AWS SageMaker.
- ⚖️ Deploying a **GenAI compliance tool** using Claude (via Bedrock) to flag internal policy violations.
- 🌪 Building **real-time MLOps platforms** with AKS, MLflow, and Prometheus for full-stack insight.

### 🔧 Tech Toolbox

- **Cloud:** Azure (ADF, AKS, ACR, Monitor), AWS (Glue, Lambda, S3, Redshift, SageMaker, Bedrock)
- **ML & MLOps:** PyTorch, XGBoost, MLflow, Kubeflow, Terraform, Azure ML, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Data Engineering:** Spark, SQL, Kafka, EventHub, Databricks, Qdrant, Feature Store (Feast)
- **Monitoring & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins

### 📂 Featured Projects

#### 🔬 SEPSIS DETECTION IN NICUs
- Built an end-to-end ML system to detect early signs of neonatal sepsis using biosignal transformation (GAF, TMF).
- Deployed on AKS with Databricks and EventHub for live inference + Grafana dashboards for clinicians.
- Integrated AUC-ROC, calibration metrics, and GDPR compliance for hospital partners.

#### 🌊 STREAMFLOW – ML IN MOTION
- Kafka + Azure ML + Databricks = real-time ML inference engine.
- Built a fault-tolerant MLOps pipeline with version control, rollback, and streaming model deployment.
- Monitoring built with Prometheus + Grafana, complete with drift alerts.

#### 🧠 GENAI COMPLIANCE INSIGHTS
- Powered by Claude (Anthropic) + Bedrock for semantic analysis of internal comms.
- Logged all LLM interactions with secure audit trails and business-rule tagging.

#### 🏙️ REAL ESTATE SIGNAL MONITORING
- 10K+ portfolio metrics parsed via AWS Glue + SageMaker + Lambda.
- Used Isolation Forest + SHAP for explainable alerts on rent spikes and vacancy gaps.

### 🧙‍♂️ Fun Fact

In the data realm, I'm part Iron Man (automation), part Doctor Strange (predictive modeling), and part Alfred (quietly making everything run smoothly). And yes, I moonlight as Gotham's silent guardian. 🦇
